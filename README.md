# SQL-Mobile-Phone-Exploration-Analyzation
In this project, we explore together the specifications of some mobile phones to support consumers make decisions about whether to buy these phones. I conducted this work, then created an Excel file to import into Power BI to visualize data into graphs for consumers.
I analyze the specifications of mobile phones by stars points, reviews points, or rating points and find out the top mobile phones in these. Furthermore, I hope these insights that are useful for consumers.
